Mod for KSP fulfilling personal gameplay favors.

### Attaching
Some parts to allow surface attachment.

### MechJeb
Parts removed and MechJeb added to all kommand modules. Changed the technology requirement of all MechJeb modules simply to Flight Control.

### ISRU
Small ISRU parts have the same performance as their large kounterparts. The small vanilla ISRU parts just suck ... and I do not see that being fun.
